Hello there.

I'm not very good at writing about pages but I suppose I'll
give it a shot. You seem to have stumbled upon my personal blog, but no fear, I'm sure someday I will have amassed plenty of random posts on this thing to keep you interested. My name is Max Phillips, although online I tend to go as BlueyBloke, and I'm a student with an interest in computer science and game studies. I plan on using this blog to post general thoughts, tutorials, game reviews and essays.

I am currently doing freelance work for general IT support and doing some tutoring on the side. If you want to get in contact with me, drop me an email [here](mailto:blueyblokegaming@gmail.com).
